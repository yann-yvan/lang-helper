Simple, structured and intuitive language helper generator for Laravel projects.

## ‚ú® Features

- üí° **Intuitive access**: Access translations like `LangHelper::auth()->password()->reset()`.
- üîÑ **Nested keys support**: Full nested language file support.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require --dev nycorp/lang-helper
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

### 1. Generate LangHelper

```bash
php artisan lang:generate
```

This will create the `app/Helpers/LangHelper.php` and related group folders.

### 2. Detect Unused Translations

```bash
php artisan lang:generate --detect-unused
```

This will list all unused translation methods.

### 3. Example Usage

```php
LangHelper::auth()->password()->reset();
LangHelper::validation()->email();
LangHelper::validation()->email($value);
```

non existing file will generate
```php
LangHelper::navigation()->home();
// will return navigation.home
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="lang-helper-config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [
    'excluded_directories' => [
        'vendor'
    ],
    'excluded_lang_files' => [
        // auth
    ],
];

```
